# Book Tracker

The app is composed of two screens. The first screen displays a list of books, in which, each book is described by its title, author and page number. After a user selects a book from the list, a second screen appears displaying book details which can then be updated. The same activity can be used for creation also.

## Overview

The app does the following:

1. Displays list of created books
2. Allows the user to view,create,update and delete their books
3. Allows the books to stored to json

3. `BookAdapter` - Responsible for mapping each `Book` to a particular view layout.
4. `BookListActivity` - Responsible for fetching and deserializing the data.
5. `FileHelpers` - Collection of methods for interacting with JSON.
6. `ImageHelpers` - Collection of methods for interacting with Images.
7. `MainApp` - Starts the application and JSON.
8. `BookJSONStore` - Methods for JSON crud and manipulating JSON.
